**Package	Purpose**

numpy:	For numerical operations (arrays, matrices, image data).
pandas:	To manage datasets, labels, and preprocessing.
matplotlib:	To visualize images and performance metrics.
seaborn:	For enhanced data visualization (heatmaps, confusion matrices).
scikit-learn:	For train-test splitting, metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).
opencv-python:	For image reading, resizing, and augmentation if needed.
tensorflow:	Deep learning framework to build/train the CNN model.
keras:	High-level API for TensorFlow (model building, callbacks).
scipy:	Useful for image augmentation, scientific computations.
Pillow:	To work with image files (opening, resizing, etc.).
