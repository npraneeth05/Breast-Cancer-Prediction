*****Dataset Description*****

The Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset is curated to aid in the development of machine learning models for breast cancer detection through ultrasound imaging. It was published by Arya Shah on Kaggle.

**Dataset Contents**
Total 780 ultrasound images.
Data organized into three classes:

Benign: Non-cancerous tumors.
Malignant: Cancerous tumors.
Normal: No tumors detected.

**Data Properties**

Image format: .png
Image size: Varies, relatively small.
Annotation: Each image is manually labeled into the correct category by a medical professional.
Purpose: Breast tumor classification using ultrasound images.

Notes:
Dataset is imbalanced; benign cases are more frequent than malignant and normal.
Ultrasound imaging is selected for its safety (no ionizing radiation) and affordability.




*****Breast Cancer Detection*****
This repository includes the Jupyter notebook Breast_cancer_detection.ipynb (uploaded) that implements a deep learning-based classification model to detect breast cancer types from ultrasound images.

**Key Components:**

*Data Loading and Preprocessing:*

Read images from directories.
Resize and normalize images.
Perform data augmentation to handle class imbalance.

*Model Building:*

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is developed from scratch (or based on pre-trained architectures if transfer learning is applied).

*Training and Validation:*

The model is trained on augmented images.
Validation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

*Results:*

Final evaluation on a held-out test set.
Confusion matrix and classification reports are generated.

*Important Points to Note*
Ethical use: Medical datasets should be handled with caution; this project is for educational and research purposes only.
Dataset license: Respect Kaggle's rules and the original dataset author's license terms.
